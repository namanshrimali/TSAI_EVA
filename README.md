# Assignment 3x - EMNIST Dataset
> Submitted by - Naman Shrimali

## Network has
   * 6 Convolution layers with these kernels (10, 10, 20, 20, 30)
   * no fully connected layer (have Global Average Pooling layer)
   * uses EMNIST as the dataset
   * uses a maximum of 2 max-pooling layers
   * Used Relu activation function for effective and easier decision making we into the model
